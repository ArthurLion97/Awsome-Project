# Info

> This directory contains all the souce code, documentation for the project we have done in IE5504 Systems Modeling and Advanced Simulation.

Particularly, we compared the performance of UCB algorithm, Bayes Bandit algorithm, and the Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) algorithm on solving the Bernoulli Bandit problems. A short introduction of multi-armed bandit problems, and various algorithms have been provided.
