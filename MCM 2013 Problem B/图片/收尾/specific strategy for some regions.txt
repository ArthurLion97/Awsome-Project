Cities like Tianjin whose water shortage are the result of poor water quality. 
At the same time, desalination of water can improve the water quality.
Consequently, it's a sensible approach for Tianjin to build desalination plant.
Apart from that, desalination can also generate other by-product. 
Currently, Tianjin has launched four relatively large desalination projects.
However, it won't meet the future water demand as we forecast. 
Meanwhile, Tianjin is relatively close to China's capital Beijing which lacks water either.
So it's a synergy to build desalination plant in Tianjin for two cities.
