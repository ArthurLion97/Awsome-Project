The LaTex codes include ¡°17444.tex¡±, ¡°17444_abstract.tex¡± and ¡°17444_body.tex¡±. We used PDFTexify to compile ¡°17444.tex¡± which in itself joins other .tex files together, with ¡°MCMthesis.sty¡± as the style of our paper.

Softwares generating our figures:
  R (ggplot2 package): figure 2, 3, 4 (a, b, c, d),6, 7, 8
  SmartDraw:           figure 1
  MATLAB:              figure 9-15
  Microsoft Visio:     figure 16
  Microsoft Excel:     figure 17

*All figures were created by members of team 17444 except figure 5. As noted in our paper, the figure comes from an atlas published in China by the Science Press, ISBN: 9787030114693 and we do not have the permission of the copuright holder of this figure. We, however, downloaded the figure freely from the internet at http://ishare.iask.sina.com.cn/f/11086240.html?from=dl .
