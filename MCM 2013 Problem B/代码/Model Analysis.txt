******************蓄水库存模型**********************
strength: 
1. Newsvendor Model for reservior can generate the minimal expected total cost which can help decision makers to better fit future uncertainty.
2. We use the data of unit water's economic contribution to local GDP in the upstream and downstream of Three Gorges Dam as holding cost and stock-out cost which both addresses fairness among different provinces and take local government's main performance indicator GDP.

weakness:
1. The model dosen't consider the factors of environment and society which are also important as economic factor.
2. The model require nearly accurate probability distribution of downstream's water demand.

***************海水淡化厂投资模型**********************
strength：
1. The model can estimate a long run social benefits for constructions of water-desalination factories.
2. It's much easier to make decisions by comparing different plans' NPV.

weakness:
1. The model doesn't consider other water supply means like water transfer and water reuse.
2. Lacking of the accurate data, we take some provinces' water gap data into modeling rather than cities which may incomparable.
3. Some more specific costs may not be added.
