#Info

> This directory contains all the source code, references, and documentations of the project we have done in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling, 2013.

- We have won the Outstanding Winner(0.2%) and the INFORMS Prize Award(0.05%) in 2013 Mathematical Contest in Modeling held by COMAP, sponsored by INFORMS, MAA, and SIAM. The problem description can be found [here](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2013/problems/).
- A grey prediction model was used to predict water gap between demand and supply across China during 2013~2025.
- Four rigorous models are proposed to address water transfer, water storage, desalinization and water conservation to handle the severe water shortage issues.
- Interplay between four strategies is analyzed, namely whether they are substitutes or complements in terms of water demand uncertainty and area properties.
- The [paper](http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-QXYY2013Z2011.htm) is published in the Mathematical Modeling and its Applications, Volume 2, 2013
