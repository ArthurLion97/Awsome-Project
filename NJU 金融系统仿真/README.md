#Info

> This directory contains all the souce code, and documentation files for the project I have done in the course "Financial Systems Simulation" when I'm in Nanjing University.

In particular, our project topic is "Credit Scoring using Random Forests." Several machine learning algorithms including the logistic regression, classification tree methods, and random forests are implemented based on R language to score the credit of the borrower. With the help of credit scoring, the business bank can alleviate the possibility of bad debt.
