#Info

> This directory contains all the source code, and documentation of the project I have done in the course "Experiments on Information Systems" when I'm at Nanjing University.

In this project, we developed a preliminary e-commerce bookstore website including the customer and administrator app. Specifically, Power Designer is adopted to depict the relationships between the business entities, and then the SQL fils are generated for us to define the database. Furthermore, the framework of Danjo is used to develop the demo of this e-commerce website.
